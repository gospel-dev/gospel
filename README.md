Welcome! Gospel is an experimental Golang web framework that allows you to write modern, reactive web applications entirely in Golang. Gospel tries to remove all worries from web development while allowing you to deliver robust functionality with amazing speed and ease. Forget about fiddling with Javascript frameworks and focus on delivering value to your users.

This is still a work in progress and quite experimental, so use it with care.
